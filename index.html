              <h1>Russia plans nuke power plant on moon within a decade</h1>
        <p><span>Russia</span> plans to put a nuclear power plant on the moon in the next decade to supply its lunar space programme  and a joint Russian Chinese research station ,as major powers rush to explore the earth's only naturel satalite.
            Roscosmos said in a statement that it planned to build lunar power plant by 2036 and signed a contract with the Lavochkin Association aerospace company to do it.
            The moon,which is 384,400 km from our planet,moderates the earth's wooble on its axis, which ensures a more stable climate.It also causes tides in the earth's oceans.
            Russia is  not the only one with such plans.Nasa in august declared its intent to put a nuclear reactor on the moon by the first quarter of fiscal year 2030.This effort is part of its broader human-return program under Artemis program.
              A lunar reactor would help to enable permanent moon base,long-duration human presence,resource mining and preparation for Mars missions.They are working with U.S. industries to design and test prototypes.
